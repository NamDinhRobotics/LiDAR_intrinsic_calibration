# intrinsic_3d_lidar_camera_calibration
## Overview
This is a package for intrinsic calibration of a 3D LiDAR 
described in paper: 3D LiDAR Intrinsic Calibration and Automatic System
for LiDAR to Camera Calibration. 
In experimental data, we show that it outperforms physics-based models for a spinning
LiDAR. In simulation, we show how this perspective can be applied to a solid state
LiDAR.  

To run the code, place the test datasets in the opts.mat_path folder, and run the main.m!

This package has been tested under MATLAB 2019a and Ubuntu 16.04.
More detailed introduction will be updated in a week. Sorry for the inconvenience!


## Abstract
Periodic intrinsic and extrinsic (re-)calibrations are essential for modern
perception and navigation systems deployed on autonomous robots. To date, intrinsic
calibration models for LiDARs have been based on hypothesized physical mechanisms for
how a spinning LiDAR functions, resulting in anywhere from three to ten parameters to
be estimated from data. Instead we propose to abstract away from the physics of a
LiDAR type (spinning vs solid state, for example) and focus on the spatial geometry
of the point cloud generated by the sensor. This leads to a unifying view of
calibration. In experimental data, we show that it outperforms physics-based models
for a spinning LiDAR. In simulation, we show how this perspective can be applied to a
solid state LiDAR. We complete the paper by reporting on an open- source automatic
system for target-based extrinsic calibration from a LiDAR to a camera.
